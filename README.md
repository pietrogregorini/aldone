# Aldone
A non-conventional geometric typeface inspired by the work of Aldo Novarese.

## The Project
Aldone has been developed as final project for Type Design course at [CPF Bauer](http://www.cfpbauer.it/2017/06/type-design/) in Milan, with the creative direction of Marta Bernstein, Erasmo Ciufo and Beatrice D'Agostino.

Aldone is a non-conventional geometric, low-contrast, sans-serif typeface designed by [Pietro Gregorini](https://www.pietrogregorini.com) featuring two different extremes which interpolates in middle.

The lighter weight is rounded and a bit narrow, taking the shapes of Recta typeface as inspiration. The bolder extreme is more squared following the footsteps of Eurostile, featuring big rounded corners and inktraps.

## Aldo Novarese
Aldone is named after Italian type designer [Aldo Novarese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Novarese), one of the most prolific and most known Italian type designer who worked between '30s and '80s.

## Collaboration
Currently the font family is at early stage with the uppercase, lowercase and numbers.
